# Boost or Bust

Billy the bouncy alien fell into a volcano! Can you help him out? All he has on him is an old beat-up jetpack. It might work... but it could also be risky.

Made by Ian C. for the 2022 GMTK Game Jam: "Roll of the Dice"
Background music track was made by Jan125 on OpenGameArt: [Stereotypical 90's space shooter music](https://opengameart.org/content/stereotypical-90s-space-shooter-music)
Aseprite was used to make the art assets

I also used Bfxr and Chiptone to make some quick sound effects.

Thanks for playing!
